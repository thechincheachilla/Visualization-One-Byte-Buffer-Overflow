Project page: https://thechincheachilla.github.io/Visualization-One-Byte-Buffer-Overflow/

Final project submission for CSE 442 AU2021 Data Visualization.
This project aims to teach the concept of one-byte-buffer overflow exploits to people
with basic programming experience. The aim of this visualization is to quickly teach 
people the high level concepts of this form of attack in order to convince them to adopt
basic security practices on a daily basis. Unlike a lengthy article, viewers should be able
to unserstand the basics of one-byte-buffer overflows in 10 minutes or less.
