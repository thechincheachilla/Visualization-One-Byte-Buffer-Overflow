    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>As we progress through the modern age of information, technology has become more accessible to the entire world population. 
      However, the advent of new innovations has the downside of proliferating exploitations that seek to take advantage of vulnerabilities. 
      Unfortunately, due to the complex and opaque nature of computer security, the majority of people remain uninformed about program safety, 
      and well-known exploits within the buffer-overflow category continue to take advantage of this lack of information and sufficient security 
      oversight. As such, we would like to focus on one of the most common forms of attack: the single-byte buffer overflow attack, a form of 
      attack that allows the attacker to take full control of a user’s program by not only reading but also overwriting memory addresses which 
      shouldn’t be accessible via the standard program execution flow. In the following sections, we will first walk you through a rudimentary 
      explanation of the stack, and from there, you will learn how array allocation in C works. Then, you will learn how C arrays are susceptible to security vulnerabilities in 
      off-by-one errors, and how attackers can take advantage of these vulnerabilities to take over programs using attack SHELL code.
    </p>
    <p>Feel free to progress through the modules at your own pace. Modules do not need to be completed in order to move onto the next one;
    multiple modules can be accessed at the same time.

    <h2>Wrapping Up:</h2> 
    <p>At this point, we hope that you have gained a basic understanding of how simple the process is for an attacker to take control of a 
      program and device through a one-byte buffer overflow. Although these types of attacks have been known for decades, and although far 
      more complex attacks exist with today’s technology, buffer overflow attacks are more prevalent than one might originally expect. As 
      recently as 2021, buffer overflow exploit vulnerabilities were discovered in a cryptographic library application known as Libgcrypt, 
      which was discovered by a Google Project Zero researcher. Moreso, Apple themselves discovered a buffer overflow exploit in the kernel 
      of iOS software which affected all iOS devices. With reports of continual buffer overflow exploits, programmers and general technology 
      users alike must continue to practice basic computer security. </p>

    <h2>Afterword:</h2>
    <p>In order to simplify the demonstration of one-byte buffer overflows and capture the main points necessary for understanding this concept, 
      the demonstrations made a few simplifications and assumptions. For the interested reader, we will discuss those below: </p>
      <br>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Determining the addresses of the ‘out’ array and our SHELL code:
      <div style="padding-left: 15px;">
        <p>In the demonstration, we assumed that the addresses of the ‘out’ array and the SHELL code were known. However, a real attacker would 
          have to determine these locations themselves. Using a program or debugger such a GDB, an attacker can step through the code and open up 
          the assembly code, which reveals addresses. As such, an attacker can “disassemble” a program and determine the memory locations of 
          variables they need with relative ease. </p>
      </div>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Endianness: 
      <div style="padding-left: 15px;">
        <p>Our flawed program also assumed the machine running it was little-endian. If you recall, the demonstration showed that we modified the least 
          significant bit of %ebp. This only happens under the assumption the machine running the program is little endian. If the machine was big-endian, 
          we would have modified the most significant bit of %ebp instead. How would an attacker need to change their strategy if this were the case? </p>
        <p>In addition, since we assumed little-endianness of our machine, this also means the way the elements were depicted in the examples with an array
          were technically backwards. However, depicting the array in a forward manner is more intuitive, and regardless, the main takeaway is 
          that an array consists of contiguous memory. </p>
      </div>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Array Null terminators:
      <div style="padding-left: 15px;">
        <p>In C, the way a program determines the end of an array is through a character called a null terminator, represented as '\0'. Normally, an attacker 
          would set the final character of an attack string to be this null terminator, however, for simplicity, the demonstration glossed over this.  </p>
      </div>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Pushing %ebp: 
      <div style="padding-left: 15px;">
        <p>Although standard to do, the demonstration made the assumption that %ebp was pushed onto the stack at all. Some programs do not do this, and 
          these programs are actually easier to exploit since accessing %eip becomes easier. How would the attacker change the strategy if they found out 
          %ebp was not actually pushed onto the stack? Where would %eip instead reside? </p>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">NOP sleds:
      <div style="padding-left: 15px;">
        <p>Oftentimes, an attacker will preload a buffer with instructions called NOP instructions (which stands for no-op), and does nothing except execute 
        the following instruction. Attackers often do this so they can point %eip to a place with NOP instructions that precedes the SHELL code, then “slide in” 
        to their SHELL code without having to directly point to it. In the demonstration, %eip was redirected to the SHELL code itself. In what cases may this 
        NOP sled trick be useful?  </p>
